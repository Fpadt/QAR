*Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)*
is an identifier for trade items, developed by GS1.[1] Such identifiers are 
used to look up product information in a database (often by entering the number 
through a barcode scanner pointed at an actual product) which may belong 
to a retailer, manufacturer, collector, researcher, or other entity. 

The GTIN standard has incorporated the International Standard Book 
Number (ISBN), International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), International 
Standard Music Number (ISMN), International Article Number (which includes 
the European Article Number and Japanese Article Number) and some Universal 
Product Codes, into a universal number space.

The uniqueness and universality of the identifier is useful in establishing 
which product in one database corresponds to which product in another database, 
especially across organizational boundaries.

GTINs may be 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits long, and each of these 4 numbering 
structures are constructed in a similar fashion, combining 
Company Prefix, Item Reference and a calculated Check Digit (GTIN-14 
adds another component- the Indicator Digit, which can be 1-8). 
GTIN-8s will be encoded in an EAN-8 barcode. GTIN-12s may be shown in UPC-A, 
ITF-14, or GS1-128 barcodes. GTIN-13s may be encoded in EAN-13, ITF-14 
or GS1-128 barcodes, and GTIN-14s may be encoded in ITF-14 or GS1-128 barcodes.

The choice of barcode will depend on the application; for example, items to be 
sold at a retail establishment could be marked with EAN-8, EAN-13, UPC-A or 
UPC-E barcodes.

**Check Digit**
The item is a one digit number that enables the scanner system to immediately 
verify the accurate data translation of the Optical Product Code as the symbol 
is scanned. 
The nine-digit Optical Product Code, plus a scanner readable check digit 
equals the ten digit total. It is represented in the bars and spaces that 
make up the complete scanner readable symbol.

The EAN-8 code is an eight-digit barcode used usually for very small articles, 
such as chewing gum, where fitting a larger code onto the item would 
be difficult. 
Note: the equivalent UPC small format barcode, UPC-E, encodes a GTIN-12 
with a special Company Prefix that allows for "zero suppression" of 
4 zeros in the GTIN-12. The GS1 encoding/decoding rules state that the 
entire GTIN-12 is used for encoding and that the entire GTIN-12 is to be 
delivered when scanned.

The OPC code is used for marking retail optical products, much like the UPC 
code is used for marking general retail items. The code uses the Interleaved 
2 of 5 barcode symbology.
Digits 1 through 5 identify the manufacturer of the item


**Optical Industry Association (OPC) Product Marking**
The OPC is a 10-digit, numeric code that identifies the manufacturer and product."

**Manufacturer Identification Number** 
The manufacturer identification number is a five digit number received from 
The Vision Council.

**Item Identification Number** 
The item is a four-digit number assigned and controlled by the 
optical manufacturer. The item number must be unique to each individual product.
